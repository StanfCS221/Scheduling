# Scheduling
Tests and solutions for Stanford's CS221 class. My part of code is in 'submission.py' file between 'BEGIN_YOUR_CODE' and 'END_YOUR_CODE'. Tests can be executed by running 'grader.py' file. More information about the assignment can be found by opening 'index.html' file. Solutions to the written part of the assignments are not published but I am happy to discuss them in person. This specific repo is focused on using CSP's and optimization techniques.
Modeling and solving the 'n queens' problem as CSP (n queens placed on nxn square grid such that no 2 queens are attacking each other). Choosing variables in descending order based on their constraint (start with the most constrained variable, if it's going to fail - lets at least fail early), lowering the number of operations. Using arc consistency (AC-3) to reduce the domain of neighboring variables and reduce the number of operations even further. Converting n-ary factors to binary factors (converting sum X1+x2+...Xn<Y to binary factors). Making an optimal schedule given constraints and wishes.
